    TODO:
    - Configure dates properly
        Two types of tasks:
            1. Something that needs to be done on a specific day. It can have a
                dueDate/dueHour, but it's optional. It only shows on one day
            2. Something that needs to be done till a specified dueDate. So it
                shows every day until the dueDate. Expired section might be 
                of use.

            Idea:
            Always show all that can be shown. If it happens that one of them
            expired simply nedote so using red border or (expired) tag.
            It can be shown if its start day is today or earlier. -///-



    - Add a form for user input -///-
    - Task changes:
            1) Style changes: Redo task squares -///-, maybe not
            2) Task description/edit system -///-
            3) Make priorites matter, border color -///-
    - FIX remove button, namely when you don't input anything in the form
        multiple tasks are made event though there is only one saved in the 
        object. it shows correctly after refresh -///-
    - FIX: prevent from changing projects when the form is opened,
        consider adding a cover just like in the library project -///-
    - FIX: project/shortcut name letters going to new line, instead only words
        -///- but can't fix long names, maybe find a way to add "-" at end when
        breaking
    - Add Local storage -///-
    - Add a confirmation form when attempting to delete a project -///-
    - Add media queries
    - change projectId and id to calculate id based on what is the biggest id
        present on the current project/projects and then add 1, this way
        it is not based on length and dupe bugs do not appear -///-
    - Fix dates for editing! -///-
    - Do something with project dates, maybe content border to signify the late
        project -///-
    - Make a refresh function, that reloads, maybe just changeProject so you
        don't have to location.reload()
    - TextArea expanding D: -///-
    - consider more cols and row for TextArea -///-
    - Rethink the need for dueDate in project, I think not needed!! -///-
    - prevent title name duplication on adding task, the form goes away for some
        reason -///-
    - ghost task appearing: bug -///-
    - make red button recover the task, you have all the data needed in the form
        , instead reworked to include only edit button -///-
    - add keybinds, especially enter instead of mouse click -///-
    - CLEAN CODE!!!!! you know currentProject repeat all the time and other jazz
    - experiment with working_task, try to remove -///-
    - rework modules, maybe no need to generalize everything, experiment
    - cleaner css, more comments, consider animations/transformations for 
        consider remaking css ground up, make it work on mobile first
    - delete the task only after the edit form is submitted, potentially use
    async/wait function
    - rework mobile design, perhaps addTask on top and calander on bottom,
    might feel more natural -///-
